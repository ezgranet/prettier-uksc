# prettier-uksc
An extension to make BAILII pretty again (and thus undo the UK Supreme Court’s vandalism of its own judgments), by removing Calibri in favour of serif typefaces, justification, and text-figures.  Brought to you by the [Legal Style Blog](https://www.legalstyle.co.uk/).
## Releases
The official release can be downloaded from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prettier-uksc/fmoeaeaikfmihnpkdabidknamagnkhcg) and all Chrome users are strongly recommended to install from there.  Users of other Chromium browsers wishing to install it can download the source in the Releases page.  If there is demand, versions may be in future submitted to other browsers’ extension/add-on stores.
